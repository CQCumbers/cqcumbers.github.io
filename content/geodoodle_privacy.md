# Geodoodle Privacy Policy

This policy applies to all information collected or submitted on Geodoodle's apps for iPhone and any other devices and platforms.

## Information We Collect

Geodoodle uses Auth0 to manage user accounts. [Auth0's privacy policy is here](https://auth0.com/privacy). Depending on how you log in, user data stored by Auth0 may include email addresses, passwords, and tokens from other login providers. This information is only used for logging in, password resets, and other account management activities. We don't send promotional emails.

When you place a pixel, Geodoodle stores the time, approximate location, and color of your pixel placement. This information is only used to generate the shared world map, rate limit placements, and block bots. Our server software may also store basic technical information, such as your IP address, in temporary memory or logs.

For performance and overload protection, we direct your traffic through Cloudflare before it reaches Geodoodle's servers. They have access to some basic technical information to perform this role, such as your IP address. [Cloudflare's privacy policy is here](https://www.cloudflare.com/privacypolicy)

## Information usage

We use the information we collect to operate and improve our services. We do not share your information with outside parties except to the extent necessary to accomplish Geodoodle's functionality. 

We may disclose your information in response to subpoenas, court orders, or other legal requirements; to exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims; to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud or abuse, violations of our policies; or to protect our rights and property.

In the future, we may sell to, buy, merge with, or partner with other businesses. In such transactions, user information may be among the transferred assets.

## Accessing, changing, or deleting information

You may access or change your information from the Geodoodle app. To delete your account, contact us at alexbrianzhang@gmail.com.

Geodoodle may delete your information at any time and for any reason, such as technical needs, legal concerns, abuse prevention, removal of idle accounts, data loss, or any other reason.
