# Hand Count Privacy Policy

This policy applies to all information collected or submitted on Hand Count's apps for iPhone and any other devices and platforms.

## Information We Collect

We store images taken with Hand Count, so they can be used to improve the accuracy of our counts in the future. These images are not associated with your device or any other user data. Our server software may also store basic technical information, such as your IP address, in temporary memory or logs.

For performance and overload protection, we direct your traffic through Cloudflare before it reaches Hand Count's servers. They have access to some basic technical information to perform this role, such as your IP address. [Cloudflare's privacy policy is here](https://www.cloudflare.com/privacypolicy)

## Information usage

We use the information we collect to operate and improve our services. We may share your images with outside parties or make them publicly available, so others can contribute to improving our services. 

We may disclose your information in response to subpoenas, court orders, or other legal requirements; to exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims; to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud or abuse, violations of our policies; or to protect our rights and property.

In the future, we may sell to, buy, merge with, or partner with other businesses. In such transactions, user information may be among the transferred assets.

## Accessing, changing, or deleting information

There is no way to access, change, or delete images collected by Hand Count.

Hand Count may delete your information at any time and for any reason, such as technical needs, legal concerns, abuse prevention, removal of idle accounts, data loss, or any other reason.

## Your Consent

By using our apps, you consent to our privacy policy.

## Changes to this policy

If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes on this page.
