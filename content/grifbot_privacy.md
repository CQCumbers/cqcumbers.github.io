# Grifbot Privacy Policy

This policy applies to all information collected or submitted through Grifbot's website and our for chatbots for Facebook and any other devices and platforms.

## Information We Collect

Grifbot temporarily stores user messages to improve the coherency of conversations with the same person. This message history is only used by Grifbot to generate its responses, and is deleted when no messages have been recieved from that user for 24 hours. Our server software may also store basic technical information, such as your IP address, in temporary memory or logs.

For performance and overload protection, we direct your traffic through Cloudflare before it reaches Grifbot's servers. They have access to some basic technical information to perform this role, such as your IP address. [Cloudflare's privacy policy is here](https://www.cloudflare.com/privacypolicy)

## Information usage

We use the information we collect to operate and improve our services. We do not share your information with outside parties.

We may disclose your information in response to subpoenas, court orders, or other legal requirements; to exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims; to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud or abuse, violations of our policies; or to protect our rights and property.

In the future, we may sell to, buy, merge with, or partner with other businesses. In such transactions, user information may be among the transferred assets.

## Accessing, changing, or deleting information

There is no way to access or change information stored by Grifbot. Information associated with a user is automatically deleted after 24 hours without recieving a message from that user.

Grifbot may delete your information at any time and for any reason, such as technical needs, legal concerns, abuse prevention, removal of idle accounts, data loss, or any other reason.
